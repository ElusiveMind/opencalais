Add
 - Add API documentation (talk about the various way to access the data)
 - Linked Data integration 
 
- Remove the search/distribute variables
 
Test
- Migrate Processing == NONE to Retrieve == NONE & Processing == SUGGEST
- The association of vocabs with Node types (I messed with calais_admin_settings_submit)
- Better way to associate nodes and vocabs using taxonomy functions instead of direct DB inserts
- Default calais saving when node settings were never enabled. There should not be an error, I now return empty arrays.
